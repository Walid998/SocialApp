## Overview

This is a base code for creating express.js server and database connection with postgres

## Prerequisites

1. NodeJs
2. Postgres

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll first need to install the project and its dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:


1. Install your dependencies

    ```
      npm install
    ```
2. Create the database and apply migrations

    ```
    npm run db:create
    npm run db:migrate
    ```

Once the project and its dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running the following command:

3. Start your app

    ```
      npm start
    ```
This will start the server on port 8000 by default. You can access the API by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints.

    ```
      npm run serve
    ```
